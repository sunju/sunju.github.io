Over the last few years, deep neural networks (DNN) have fundamentally transformed the way people think of machine learning and approach practical problems. Successes around DNN have ranged from traditional AI fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, interactive games, to health care, physical sciences---touching each and every corner of theoretical and applied domains. On the other hand, DNN still largely operate as black-boxes and we only have very limited understanding as for when and why they work. This course introduces basic ingredients of DNN, samples important applications, and throws around open problems. Emphasis is put on thinking from first principles, as the field is still evolving rapidly and there is nothing there that cannot be changed.

More details are forthcoming!
