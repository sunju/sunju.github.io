I'm Ju Sun, a [Math+X](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/funding/funding-opportunities/mathematics-physical-sciences/mathx/mathx-encouraging-interactions-chair-recipients/) postdoctoral scholar working with [Professor Emmanuel Candes](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). Prior to this, I obtained my PhD degree from [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.columbia.edu/), [Columbia University](http://www.columbia.edu/) in 2016, working with [Professor John Wright](http://www.columbia.edu/~jw2966/). I work at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, numerical optimization, signal/image processing, information theory, and compressive sensing, focusing on modeling, harnessing, and computing with structures in massive data, with provable guarantees and practical algorithms. 

\[<span style="color:red">**New**</span>\] As of year 2017/2018, I'm on the academic job market. See my \[[CV](/docs/CV.pdf)\] and \[[Research Statement](/docs/RS.pdf)\].
