- **Paper release**: our new paper [Dual-Reference Design for Holographic Coherent Diffraction Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02492) is on arXiv. We show that augmenting both the pinhole and block references in holographic CDI can combine the best parts of both! (Feb 07, 2019)
- **Paper release**: full version of the paper [Holographic Phase Retrieval and Optimal Reference Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06453) on arXiv. We show how the difficult Fourier phase retrieval problem can be substantially simplified and robustly solved in practical CDI (i.e., Coherent Diffraction Imaging) setting, with a simple augmented reference.

- Visiting Georgia Institute of Technology (Nov 29--30, 2018)
- [Talk at SINE Seminar Coordinated Science Laboratory, UIUC](https://calendars.illinois.edu/detail/4200/33321967) (Nov 05, 2018)
- **Paper release**: full version of the paper [Subgradient Descent Learns Orthogonal Dictionaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10702) on arXiv. We show that nonconvexity and nonsmoothness can be tackled together rigorously on practical problems. (Oct 25 2018)
