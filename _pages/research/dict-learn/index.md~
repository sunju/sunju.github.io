Learning dictionaries/atomic sets that induce structured representation on data. Applications are still explosively emerging, especially of deep learning, where one allows multi-level nonlinear cascading of representation. Hence formulations to the problems are fairly diverse. We will roughly organize the references according to the problem they try to solve, concentrated on theoretical literature.  (**Update: Jan 05 2016**)

## Theory 

### $\mathbf{Y} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{A}$ Square, Invertible, Global Recovery 
This problem can be reduced to a sequence of problems, each taking the form of finding sparsest vector in a linear subspace. See also [Structured Element Pursuit](/research/struct-elem/).
