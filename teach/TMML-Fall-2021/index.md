title: Topics in Modern Machine Learning
---

#### Theme of this iteration

 **theoretical foundations of deep learning**... puts classic learning theory in the context of modern deep learning, and examines deep learning through the lens of classic and modern approximation, optimization, and  learning theory

#### Registration  

**What this course is NOT about**: [Introduction to deep learning](https://sunju.org/teach/DL-Fall-2020/), or classic machine learning topics covered in [CSCI5525](https://sunju.org/teach/ML-Spring-2021/).  These courses are part of the prerequisites (see below).

**Instructor consent only**. This is PhD-level special topics course in theoretical/mathematical understanding of deep learning, and targets PhD students with research focus/interest in the foundations of modern machine learning and data science. This course is math-heavy and research-oriented: both course **and** research experience in advanced machine learning ([CSCI5525 or equivalent](https://sunju.org/teach/ML-Spring-2021/)) and deep learning ([CSCI5980: Think Deep Learning or equivalent](https://sunju.org/teach/ML-Spring-2021/)) are expected, and maturity in linear algebra, multivariate calculus, probability, and numerical optimization is assumed. **To get a permission number, please email the instructor and describe how your course and research experience has prepared you for this course**.
