### Theme of this iteration

 **theoretical foundations of deep learning**... examines deep learning through the lens of classic and modern approximation, optimization, and learning theory
<!-- 
#### Registration  

**What this course is NOT about**: [Introduction to deep learning](https://sunju.org/teach/DL-Fall-2020/), or classic machine learning topics covered in [CSCI5525](https://sunju.org/teach/ML-Spring-2021/).  These courses are part of the prerequisites (see below).

**Instructor consent only**. This is PhD-level special topics course in theoretical/mathematical understanding of deep learning, and targets PhD students with research focus/interest in the foundations of modern machine learning and data science. This course is math-heavy and research-oriented: both course **and** research experience in advanced machine learning ([CSCI5525 or equivalent](https://sunju.org/teach/ML-Spring-2021/)) and deep learning ([CSCI5980: Think Deep Learning or equivalent](https://sunju.org/teach/ML-Spring-2021/)) are expectex-special/nautilus-clipboard
