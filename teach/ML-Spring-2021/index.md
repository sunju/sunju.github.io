title: Advanced Machine Learning
---

What are state-of-the-art machine learning methods, and why they work? This graduate-level
introductory course to machine learning focuses on the foundations of modern machine learning.
We will cover selected topics from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and interactive
learning. For each topic, key algorithmic ideas/intuitions and basic theoretical insights will be
highlighted. The end goal is that the students will be able to develop and deploy novel learning
methods for their applications, and potentially derive basic theoretical understanding
