#### Past

- **Paper release**: Proud to release our extended abstract [Phase Retrieval using Single-Instance Deep Generative Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04812) that demonstrates single-instance deep generative priors (e.g., deep image priors) could be a powerful tool solving the most difficult cases of Fourier phase retrieval, a cental problem in computational imaging. (Jun 9, 2021)  
- **Paper release**: Proud to release our paper [Rethink Transfer Learning in Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05152) showing that transfer learning for medical image classification should probably be performed on truncated deep models, rather than full deep models conventionally used.  (Jun 9, 2021)   
- **Paper release**: Proud to release our paper [A Prospective Observational Study to Investigate Performance of a Chest X-ray Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic Support Tool Across 12 U.S. Hospitals](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.04.21258316) that describes our year-long project on X-ray-based COVID-19 diagnostic system that has been 1) trained on extensive internal and public data, 2) carefully validated externally, and 3) deployed in real hospitals. See also the common pitfalls of the majority of AI models for COVID-19 [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00307-0) and [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-021-00338-7). AI is to complement and assist but not replace doctors, and close collaboration between AI experts and medical doctors is **essential** to building trustworthy AI models for healthcare.
