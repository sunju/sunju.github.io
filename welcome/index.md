#### Past

- **Paper release**: Proud to release our paper [Early Stopping for Deep Image Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06074) on arXiv! This is our early stopping method Ver 2.0 for single-instance deep generative priors. This version is as effective as [our first method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12271) but is much more efficient! (Dec 13, 2021)     
- **Paper release**: Proud to release our paper [NCVX: A User-Friendly and Scalable Package for Nonconvex Optimization in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13984) on arXiv! [NCVX](https://ncvx.org/) is the initial translation and revamping of the [GRANSO package](http://www.timmitchell.com/software/GRANSO/), with convenient features such as auto-differentiation and GPU support. In particular, NCVX can be used to solve constrained deep learning problems.  (Nov 29, 2021)
